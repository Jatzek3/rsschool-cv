Hi!

I am passionate about Information Technology in general and as well in programing. Till this point I was learning Python, spend my time while learning it very well and I'm quite fond about my skills and knowledge of Python.

But Python itself is only a language, and i had to find a field to use my Python skills. Since I like design, and whole graphic end of websites I decided that i will go with learning the Frontend as well in pursuit of finding a job. So I joined RSS school and now I am eager learner of JavaScript(still prefer Python though;)

It's easy for me to learn, discover and work remotely because i already had a profession in which i excelled and it was grounded on this basis. I was professional online poker player.

## Skills:
 - Python
 - Django +  (A little bit of Flask)
 - SQL
 - git
 (+ basics of JavasScript, HTML\CSS, UML, Bash)
 
 ### Tools 
 Pycharm, VSCode, Github, Heroku, LucidChart
 (+ many job-related networking tools like Putty, VNC, RDP, Sharepoint, JIRA)

## Projects

While learning from books and tutorials i made countless Python application and about Ten Django Projects, Managed to resolve about 50 Python Beginner and Junior CodeWars Kata, and some of beginner JavaScript ones:
Below are my own projects:
### A Website Written in Django. 
[https://learn-python-programming.herokuapp.com/](https://learn-python-programming.herokuapp.com/)
I'm very proud of it becouse during development i encountered many obstacles, and resolving them was very difficult. Here is the source code for it:

Most of learning resources from which i was gaining knowledge is described on the webpage. And for now it is the place where i store my recollection of materials. In future I plan it to become Very robust website with vast ammount of options.

### Small OOP projects

I am proficient in English, and been learning it from very young age. At tests I score C2 mostly, but i donâ€™t think it's fair. Writing for me isn't as easy for me as I would like it to be and I make many mistakes also don't know grammar very well. On the other side i can communicate very fluently and my comprehension in either written and spoken english is on a very high level.
